REDIT SOCIAL NETWORK:

-> the downvotes are not provided in the db. "downs": 0, but we have the ratio up vs down.

---num of upvotes/ num of comments -> the upvotes and the number of comments are not corralated:
-Biden and Cripto have the most comments, jockes have the more likes
-> cripto post(about how they lost 2 banks) got the most down votes. it is a meme, but it's a more sensitive subject than a cat jock.
Also the last post, about President Biden, but the link is not working anymore( DB is not up to date)


-> we don't have the number of TOTAL visitors (visited : False.)



-> it would be interesting to know the number of POSITIF comments, and NEGATIF comments. Instead of simply comment, users would have to choose between POSITIF comment, and NEGATIF comment.
BUT, comments are not always in ONE WAY. it s not as simple as like or dislike, sometimes it's both.
